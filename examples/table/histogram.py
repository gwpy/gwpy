Plotting an `EventTable` in a histogram
#######################################

I would like to study the distribution of the GW events detected to date.
"""

# %%
# First, we can download the ``'GWTC-1-confident'`` catalogue using
# :meth:`EventTable.fetch_open_data`:

from gwpy.table import EventTable
events = EventTable.fetch_open_data(
    "GWTC",
    columns=("mass_1_source", "mass_2_source"),
)
events.add_column(
    events["mass_1_source"] + events["mass_2_source"],
    name="mtotal"
)

# %%
# and can generate a new `~gwpy.plot.Plot` using the
# :meth:`~EventTable.hist` method:

plot = events.hist("mtotal", bins=20, range=(0, 100), histtype="stepfilled")
ax = plot.gca()
ax.set_xlabel(r"Total mass [M$_{\odot}$]")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of events")
ax.set_title("GWTC events")
plot.show()
