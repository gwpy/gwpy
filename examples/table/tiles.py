"""Plotting events as 2-d tiles

I would like to study the event triggers generated by the `ExcessPower <link>`_
gravitational-wave burst detection algorithm, over a small stretch of data.

The data from which these events were generated are a simulation of Gaussian noise
with the Advanced LIGO design spectrum, and so don't actually contain any real
gravitational waves, but will help tune the algorithm to improve detection of
future, real signals.

# First, we import the `EventTable` object and read in a set of events from
# a LIGO_LW-format XML file containing a
# :class:`sngl_burst <glue.ligolw.lsctables.SnglBurstTable>` table
from gwpy.table import EventTable
events = EventTable.read(
    'H1-LDAS_STRAIN-968654552-10.xml.gz', format='ligolw.sngl_burst',
    columns=['time', 'central_freq', 'bandwidth', 'duration', 'snr'])

# .. note::
#
#    Here we manually specify the `columns` to read in order to optimise
#    the `read()` operation to parse only the data we actually need.

# We can make a plot of these events as 2-dimensional tiles by specifying
# the x- and y-axis columns, and the widths in those directions:
plot = events.plot('time', 'central_freq', 'duration', 'bandwidth',
