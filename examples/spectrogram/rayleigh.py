"""Plotting a `Spectrogram` of the Rayleigh statistic

I would like to study the gravitational wave strain spectrogram around the time of an interesting simulated signal during the last science run (S6).

# First, we import the :class:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries` and :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.get` the data:
from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
gwdata = TimeSeries.get(
    'H1:LDAS-STRAIN', 'September 16 2010 06:40', 'September 16 2010 06:50')

# Next, we can calculate a Rayleigh statistic `Spectrogram` using the 
# :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.rayleigh_spectrogram` method of the #
# `~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries` and a 5-second stride with a 2-second FFT and 
# 1-second overlap (50%):
rayleigh = gwdata.rayleigh_spectrogram(5, fftlength=2, overlap=1)

# and can make a plot using the :meth:`~Spectrogram.plot` method
plot = rayleigh.plot(norm='log', vmin=0.25, vmax=4)
plot.set_yscale('log')
plot.set_ylim(40, 4000)
plot.add_colorbar(cmap='BrBG_r', label=r'Rayleigh statistic')
plot.show()
