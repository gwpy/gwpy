"""Plotting a whitened `Spectrogram`

I would like to study the gravitational wave strain spectrogram around the time of an interesting simulated signal during the last science run (S6).

# As with :doc:`previous example <plot>`, we import the
# `~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries` class,
# :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.get` the data, and calculate a 
# `Spectrogram`
from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
gwdata = TimeSeries.get('H1:LDAS-STRAIN', 'September 16 2010 06:40', 'September 16 2010 06:50')
specgram = gwdata.spectrogram(5, fftlength=2, overlap=1) ** (1/2.)

# To whiten the `specgram` we can use the :meth:`~Spectrogram.ratio` method
# to divide by the overall median:
medratio = specgram.ratio('median')

# Finally, we make a plot:
plot = medratio.plot(norm='log', vmin=0.1, vmax=10)
plot.set_yscale('log')
plot.set_ylim(40, 4096)
plot.add_colorbar(label='Amplitude relative to median')
plot.show()
