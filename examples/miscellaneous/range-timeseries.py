"""Generating an inspiral range timeseries

The standard metric of the sensitivity of a gravitational-wave detector
is the distance to which a canonical binary neutron star (BNS) inspiral
(with two 1.4 solar mass components) would be detected with a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8.

We can estimate using :func:`gwpy.astro.inspiral_range` after calculating
the power-spectral density (PSD) of the strain readout for a detector, and
can plot the variation over time by looping over a power spectral density
:class:`~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram`.
"""

# First, we need to load some data, for this we can use the
# `public data <https://www.gw-openscience.org/catalog/>`__
# around the GW150914 event:

from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
h1 = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('H1', 1126257414, 1126261510)
l1 = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', 1126257414, 1126261510)

# and then calculating the PSD spectrogram:

h1spec = h1.spectrogram(30, fftlength=4)
l1spec = l1.spectrogram(30, fftlength=4)

# To calculate the inspiral range variation, we need to create a
# :class:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries` in which to store the values, then
# loop over each PSD bin in the spectrogram, calculating the
# :func:`gwpy.astro.inspiral_range` for each one:

import numpy
from gwpy.astro import inspiral_range
h1range = TimeSeries(numpy.zeros(len(h1spec)),
                     dt=h1spec.dt, t0=h1spec.t0, unit='Mpc')
l1range = h1range.copy()
for i in range(h1range.size):
    h1range[i] = inspiral_range(h1spec[i], fmin=10)
    l1range[i] = inspiral_range(l1spec[i], fmin=10)

# We can now easily plot the timeseries to see the variation in LIGO
# sensitivity over the hour or so including GW150914:

plot = h1range.plot(label='LIGO-Hanford', color='gwpy:ligo-hanford',
                    figsize=(12, 5))
ax = plot.gca()
ax.plot(l1range, label='LIGO-Livingston', color='gwpy:ligo-livingston')
ax.set_ylabel('Angle-averaged sensitive distance [Mpc]')
ax.set_title('LIGO sensitivity to BNS around GW150914')
ax.set_epoch(1126259462)  # <- set 0 on plot to GW150914
ax.legend()
plot.show()
