Calculate and plot a `FrequencySeries`
######################################

One of the principal means of estimating the sensitivity of a
gravitational-wave detector is to esimate it's amplitude spectral density
(ASD).
The ASD is a measurement of how a signal's amplitude varies across
different frequencies.

The ASD can be estimated directly from a `TimeSeries` using the
:meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.asd` method.
"""

# %%
# Data access
# -----------
# For this example we choose to estimate the ASD around |GW200115|_,
# one of the first observations of a neutron star-black hole binary.
# We can use the |gwosc-mod| Python package to query for the relevant GPS time:

from gwosc.datasets import event_gps
gps = event_gps("GW200115")

# %%
# In order to generate a `FrequencySeries` we need to import the
# `~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries` and use
# :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.fetch_open_data` to download the strain
# records:

from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
lho = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data("H1", gps - 16, gps + 16)
llo = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data("L1", gps - 16, gps + 16)

# %%
# Calculate the ASDs
# ------------------
# We can then call the :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.asd` method to
# calculated the amplitude spectral density for each
# `~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries`:

lhoasd = lho.asd(4, 2)
lloasd = llo.asd(4, 2)

# %%
# Visualisation
# -------------
# We can then :meth:`~FrequencySeries.plot` the spectra using the 'standard'
# colour scheme:

plot = lhoasd.plot(label="LIGO-Hanford", color="gwpy:ligo-hanford")
ax = plot.gca()
ax.plot(lloasd, label="LIGO-Livingston", color="gwpy:ligo-livingston")
ax.set_xlim(16, 1600)
ax.set_ylim(1e-24, 1e-21)
ax.set_ylabel(r"Strain ASD [1/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}]$")
ax.legend(frameon=False, bbox_to_anchor=(1., 1.), loc="lower right", ncol=2)
plot.show()
