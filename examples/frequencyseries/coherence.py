"""Calculating the coherence between two channels

The `coherence <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)>`_ between
two channels is a measure of the frequency-domain correlation between their
time-series data.

In LIGO, the coherence is a crucial indicator of how noise sources couple into
the main differential arm-length readout.

In this example we calculate the coherence between two length-sensing
degrees of freedom, the Signal-Recycling Cavity length (SRCL), and the
Common-Arm motion (CARM).

# First, we import the `TimeSeriesDict`
from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeriesDict

# and then :meth:`~TimeSeriesDict.get` both data sets:
data = TimeSeriesDict.get(['L1:LSC-SRCL_IN1_DQ', 'L1:LSC-CARM_IN1_DQ'],
                           'Feb 13 2015', 'Feb 13 2015 00:15', allow_tape=True)

# We can then calculate the :meth:`~TimeSeries.coherence` of one
# `TimeSeries` with respect to the other, using an 8-second Fourier
# transform length, with a 4-second (50%) overlap:
coh = data['L1:LSC-SRCL_IN1_DQ'].coherence(data['L1:LSC-CARM_IN1_DQ'], 8, 4)

# Finally, we can :meth:`~gwpy.frequencyseries.FrequencySeries.plot` the resulting data:
plot = coh.plot(figsize=[12, 6], label=None)
ax = plot.gca()
ax.set_yscale('linear')
ax.set_xlabel('Frequency [Hz]')
ax.set_ylabel('Coherence')
ax.set_title('Coherence between SRCL and CARM for L1')
