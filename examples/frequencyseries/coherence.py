"""Calculating the coherence between two channels

The `coherence <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)>`_ between
two channels is a measure of the frequency-domain correlation between their
time-series data.

In LIGO, the coherence is a crucial indicator of how noise sources couple into
the main differential arm-length readout.
Here we use use the :meth:`TimeSeries.coherence` method to highlight coupling
of motion of a beam periscope attached to the main laser table into the
strain output of the LIGO-Hanford interferometer.

# First, we import the `TimeSeriesDict`
from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeriesDict

# and then :meth:`~TimeSeriesDict.get` the data for the strain output
# (``H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN``) and the PSL periscope accelerometer
# (``H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_PERISCOPE_X_DQ``):
data = TimeSeriesDict.get(['H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN',
                           'H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_PERISCOPE_X_DQ'],
                           1126260017, 1126260617)
hoft = data['H1:GDS-CALIB_STRAIN']
acc = data['H1:PEM-CS_ACC_PSL_PERISCOPE_X_DQ']

# We can then calculate the :meth:`~TimeSeries.coherence` of one
# `TimeSeries` with respect to the other, using an 2-second Fourier
# transform length, with a 1-second (50%) overlap:
coh = hoft.coherence(acc, fftlength=2, overlap=1)

# Finally, we can :meth:`~gwpy.frequencyseries.FrequencySeries.plot` the resulting data:
plot = coh.plot(figsize=[12, 6], label=None)
ax = plot.gca()
ax.set_xlabel('Frequency [Hz]')
ax.set_ylabel('Coherence')
ax.set_yscale('linear')
ax.set_ylim(0, 1)
ax.set_title('Coherence between PSL periscope motion and LIGO-Hanford strain data')
plot.show()

# We can clearly see the correlation between the periscope motion and the
# strain data between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz. Once this was discovered the
# motion was damped by modifying the structure of the periscope itself,
# reducing the coupling into the gravitational-wave strain output.
