"""Calculating and plotting a `SpectralVariance` histogram

The most common visualisation of the spectral content of a data series is
via the power or amplitude spectral density calculations (PSD or ASD).
However, these typically involve averaging of the data over a period, which
can wash out transient noise (as is often desired).

The `SpectralVariance` histogram provide by `gwpy.frequencyseries` allows
us to look at the spectral sensitivity in a different manner, displaying
which frequencies sit at which amplitude _most_ of the time, but also
highlighting excursions from normal behaviour.

# To demonstate this, we can load some data from the LIGO Livingston
# intereferometer around the time of the GW151226 gravitational wave detection:

from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
llo = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', 1135136228, 1135140324, verbose=True)

# We can then call the :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.spectral_variance`
# method of the ``llo`` `~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries` by calculating an ASD
# every 5 seconds and counting the amount of time each frequency bin spends
# at each ASD value:

variance = llo.spectral_variance(5, fftlength=2, overlap=1, log=True,
                                 low=1e-24, high=1e-19, nbins=100)

# We can then :meth:`~SpectralVariance.plot` the `SpectralVariance`

plot = variance.plot(norm='log', vmin=.5, cmap='plasma',
                     xscale='log', xlim=(20, 1500), xlabel='Frequency [Hz]',
                     yscale='log', ylim=(1e-24, 1e-20),
                     ylabel=r'[strain/\rtHz]',
                     title='LIGO-Livingston sensitivity variance')
plot.show()

# From this we see that in general the sensitivity varies a few parts in 
# 10 :sup:`-23`, while many of the lines (narrow-band peaks in the spectrum)
# are much more stationary.
