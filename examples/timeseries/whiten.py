"""Whitening a `TimeSeries`

Most data recorded from a gravitational-wave interferometer carry information
across a wide band of frequencies, typically up to a few kiloHertz, but
often it is the case that the low-frequency amplitude dwarfs that of the
high-frequency content, making discerning high-frequency features difficult.

We employ a technique called 'whitening' to normalize the power at all
frequencies so that excess power at any frequency is more obvious.

We demonstrate below with an auxiliary signal recording transmitted power
in one of the interferometer arms, which recorded two large glitches with
a frequency of around 5-50Hz.

# First, we import the `TimeSeries` and `~TimeSeries.fetch` the data:
from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
data = TimeSeries.fetch('H1:ASC-Y_TR_A_NSUM_OUT_DQ', 1123084670, 1123084800)

# Now, we can `~TimeSeries.whiten` the data to enhance the higher-frequency
# content
white = data.whiten(4, 2)

# and can `~TimeSeries.plot` both the original and whitened data
epoch = 1123084687.570
plot = data.plot()
plot.axes[0].set_ylabel('Y-arm power [counts]', fontsize=16)
plot.add_timeseries(white, newax=True, sharex=plot.axes[0])
plot.axes[1].set_ylabel('Whitened amplitude', fontsize=16)

# Here we see two large spikes that are completely undetected in the raw
# `TimeSeries`, but are very obvious in the whitened data.
