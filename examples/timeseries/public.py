"""Accessing and visualising public GW detector data

Data from the current generation gravitational wave detectors are published
by |GWOSCl| and freely available to the public.
In this example we demonstrate how to identify times of a published
GW detection event, and to download and visualise detector data.

__author__ = "Duncan Macleod <duncan.macleod@ligo.org>"
__currentmodule__ = "pydischarge.timeseries"

# Firstly, we can use the |gwosc-mod| Python package to query for the
# time of the first gravitational-wave detection |GW150914|:

from gwosc.datasets import event_gps
gps = event_gps("GW150914")

# pyDischarge's `TimeSeries` class provides an interface to the public |GWOSC|
# data in the :meth:`~TimeSeries.fetch_open_data` method; to use it we
# need to first import the `TimeSeries` object:

from pydischarge.timeseries import TimeSeries

# then call the :meth:`~TimeSeries.fetch_open_data` method, passing it the
# prefix for the interferometer we want (`'L1'` here for LIGO-Livingston),
# and the GPS start and stop times of our query (based around the GPS time
# for GW150914):

data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', gps-5, gps+5)

# and then we can make a plot:

plot = data.plot(
    title="LIGO Livingston Observatory data for GW150914",
    ylabel="Strain amplitude",
    color="pydischarge:ligo-livingston",
    epoch=gps,
)
plot.show()

# We can't see anything that looks like a gravitational wave signal in these
# data, the amplitude is dominated by low-frequency detector noise.
# Further filtering is required to be able to identify the GW150914 event
# here, see :ref:`pydischarge-example-signal-gw150914` for a more in-depth example of
# extracting signals from noise.
