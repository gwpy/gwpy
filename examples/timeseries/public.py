"""Plotting public LIGO data

I would like to study the gravitational wave strain time-series around the
time of an interesting simulated signal during the last science run (S6).

These data are public, so we can load them directly from the web.

# The `TimeSeries` object has a `classmethod` dedicated to fetching open-access
# data hosted by the LIGO Open Science Center, so we can just import that
# object
from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries

# then call the `~TimeSeries.fetch_open_data` method, passing it the prefix
# for the interferometer we want ('L1'), and the GPS start and stop times of
# our query:
data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', 968654552, 968654562)

# and then we can make a plot:
plot = data.plot(
    title='LIGO Livingston Observatory data for HW100916',
    ylabel='Strain amplitude',
)
plot.show()
