"""Input/output routines for gravitational-wave frame (GWF) format files.

The API for GWF I/O integration is defined by the core module, which
specifies that each backend module provides two functions:

`read`
    A function that takes in a source reference (file path) and a list of
    channels to read, and returns a `TimeSeriesDict` of data.

`write`
    A function that takes in a `TimeSeriesDict` of data and a target reference
    (file path) and writes the data to that file.

See `gwpy.timeseries.io.gwf.core.read_timeseriesdict` and
`gwpy.timeseries.io.gwf.core.write_timeseriesdict` for full function
signatures and docstrings.

A backend module can then register itself to act as a backend for the
`format='gwf'` series reader by calling the
`gwpy.timeseries.io.gwf.core.register_gwf_backend` function.
