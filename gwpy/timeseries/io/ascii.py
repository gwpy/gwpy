    Parameters
    ----------
    input : `str`, `file`
        File to read.

    array_type : `type`
        Desired return type.

    start : `float`, `astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        The desired start point of the X-axis, defaults to
        the start point of the incoming series.

        The desired end point of the X-axis, defaults to
        the end point of the incoming series.

    kwargs
        All other keyword arguments are passed to
        `numpy.loadtxt`.

    Returns
    -------
    series : instance of ``array_type``
        The data series as read from the input file.

    See also
    --------
