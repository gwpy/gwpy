    """Preprocess a `list` of file paths for reading.

    This function does the following:

    1. read the list of paths cache file (if necessary),
    2. sort the cache in time order (if possible),
    3. sieve the cache to only include data we need.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cache : `list`, `str`, `pathlib.Path`, `file`
        List of file paths, or a reference to a cache file.

    start : `~gwpy.time.LIGOTimeGPS`, `float`, `str`, optional
        GPS start time of required data, defaults to start of data found;
        any input parseable by `~gwpy.time.to_gps` is fine.

    end : `~gwpy.time.LIGOTimeGPS`, `float`, `str`, optional
        GPS end time of required data, defaults to end of data found;
        any input parseable by `~gwpy.time.to_gps` is fine.

    sort : `callable`, optional
        A callable key function by which to sort the file paths.

    Returns
    -------
    modcache : `list`
        A parsed, sieved list of paths based on the input arguments.

    --------
