    - read the cache from the file (if necessary)

    Parameters
    ----------
    cache : `list`, `str`
        List of file paths, or path to a LAL-format cache file on disk.

    start : `~gwpy.time.LIGOTimeGPS`, `float`, `str`, optional

        any input parseable by `~gwpy.time.to_gps` is fine.

        GPS end time of required data, defaults to end of data found;
        any input parseable by `~gwpy.time.to_gps` is fine.

    Returns
    -------
    modcache : `list`
        A parsed, sieved list of paths based on the input arguments.
