    unit : `~astropy.units.Unit`, optional
        Physical unit of these data.

    t0 : `~gwpy.time.LIGOTimeGPS`, `float`, `str`, optional
        GPS epoch associated with these data,
        any input parsable by `~gwpy.time.to_gps` is fine.

    dt : `float`, `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        Time between successive samples (seconds), can also be given inversely
        via `sample_rate`.

    sample_rate : `float`, `~astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        The rate of samples per second (Hertz), can also be given inversely via `dt`.

    times : `array-like`
        The complete array of GPS times accompanying the data for this series.
        This argument takes precedence over `t0` and `dt` so should be given
        in place of these if relevant, not alongside.

    name : `str`, optional
        Descriptive title for this array.

    channel : `~gwpy.detector.Channel`, `str`, optional

    copy : `bool`, optional
        Choose to copy the input data to new memory.

    subok : `bool`, optional
        Allow passing of sub-classes by the array generator.

    Notes
    -----
    The necessary metadata to reconstruct timing information are recorded
    in the `epoch` and `sample_rate` attributes. This time-stamps can be
    returned via the :attr:`~TimeSeries.times` property.

        Examples

        We can design an arbitrarily complicated filter using

        >>> zpk = filter_design.concatenate_zpks(bp, *notches)

        And then can download some data from GWOSC to apply it using
        `TimeSeries.filter`:

        >>> from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries

            A list of time segments defining the deadtime (i.e., masked
            portions) of the output, will supersede `flag` if given.

            `deadtime` is not given.

            If `True`, will query for publicly released data-quality segments
            through the Gravitational-wave Open Science Center (GWOSC).

        const : `float`, optional
            Constant value with which to mask deadtime data.

        tpad : `float`, optional
            Length of time (in seconds) over which to taper off data at
            mask segment boundaries.

        kwargs : `dict`, optional
            Additional keyword arguments to
            `~gwpy.segments.DataQualityFlag.query` or
            `~gwpy.segments.DataQualityFlag.fetch_open_data`,
            see "Notes" below.

        Returns
        -------
        out : `TimeSeries`
            The masked version of this `TimeSeries`.

        Notes
        -----
        If `tpad` is nonzero, the Planck-taper window is used to smoothly
        ramp data down to zero over a timescale `tpad` approaching every
        segment boundary in `deadtime`. However, this does not apply to
        the left or right bounds of the original `TimeSeries`.

        The `deadtime` segment list will always be coalesced and restricted to
        the limits of `self.span`. In particular, when querying a data-quality
        flag, this means the `start` and `end` arguments to
        `~gwpy.segments.DataQualityFlag.query` will effectively be reset and
        therefore need not be given.

        If `flag` is interpreted positively, i.e. if `flag` being active
        corresponds to a "good" state, then its complement in `self.span`
        will be used to define the deadtime for masking.

        Examples
        --------
        Demodulation is useful when trying to examine steady sinusoidal
        signals we know to be contained within data. For instance,
        we can download some data from GWOSC to look at trends of the
        amplitude and phase of LIGO Livingston's calibration line at 331.3 Hz:

        >>> from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
        >>> data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', 1131350417, 1131357617)

        We can demodulate the `TimeSeries` at 331.3 Hz with a stride of one
        minute:

        >>> amp, phase = data.demodulate(331.3, stride=60)

        We can then plot these trends to visualize fluctuations in the
        amplitude of the calibration line:

        >>> from gwpy.plot import Plot
        >>> plot = Plot(amp)
        >>> ax = plot.gca()
        >>> ax.set_ylabel('Strain Amplitude at 331.3 Hz')

        Notes
        -----
        This is similar to the :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.demodulate`
        method, but is more general in that it accepts a varying phase
        evolution, rather than a fixed frequency.

        Unlike :meth:`~gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.demodulate`, the complex
        output is double-sided by default, so is not multiplied by 2.

        Examples
        --------
        Heterodyning can be useful in analysing quasi-monochromatic signals
        with a known phase evolution, such as continuous-wave signals
        from rapidly rotating neutron stars. These sources radiate at a
        frequency that slowly decreases over time, and is Doppler modulated
        due to the Earth's rotational and orbital motion.

        To see an example of heterodyning in action, we can simulate a signal
        whose phase evolution is described by the frequency and its first
        derivative with respect to time. We can download some O1 era
        LIGO-Livingston data from GWOSC, inject the simulated signal, and
        recover its amplitude.

        >>> from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
        >>> data = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data('L1', 1131350417, 1131354017)

        We now need to set the signal parameters, generate the expected
        phase evolution, and create the signal:

        >>> import numpy
        >>> f0 = 123.456789  # signal frequency (Hz)
        >>> fdot = -9.87654321e-7  # signal frequency derivative (Hz/s)
        >>> fepoch = 1131350417  # phase epoch
        >>> amp = 1.5e-22  # signal amplitude
        >>> phase0 = 0.4  # signal phase at the phase epoch
        >>> times = data.times.value - fepoch
        >>> phase = 2 * numpy.pi * (f0 * times + 0.5 * fdot * times**2)
        >>> signal = TimeSeries(amp * numpy.cos(phase + phase0),
        >>>                     sample_rate=data.sample_rate, t0=data.t0)
        >>> data = data.inject(signal)

        To recover the signal, we can bandpass the injected data around the
        signal frequency, then heterodyne using our phase model with a stride
        of 60 seconds:

        >>> filtdata = data.bandpass(f0 - 0.5, f0 + 0.5)
        >>> het = filtdata.heterodyne(phase, stride=60, singlesided=True)

        We can then plot signal amplitude over time (cropping the first two
        minutes to remove the filter response):

        >>> plot = het.crop(het.x0.value + 180).abs().plot()
        >>> ax = plot.gca()
        >>> ax.set_ylabel("Strain amplitude")
        >>> plot.show()

        By default, this method returns a high-resolution spectrogram in
        both time and frequency, which can result in a large memory
        footprint. If you know that you only need a subset of the output
        for, say, a figure, consider using ``outseg`` and the other
        keyword arguments to restrict the size of the returned data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        qrange : `tuple` of `float`, optional
            ``(low, high)`` range of Qs to scan.

        frange : `tuple` of `float`, optional
            ``(log, high)`` range of frequencies to scan.

        gps : `float`, optional
            Central time of interest for determine loudest Q-plane.

        search : `float`, optional
            Window around `gps` in which to find peak energies, only
            used if `gps` is given.

        tres : `float`, optional
            Desired time resolution (seconds) of output `Spectrogram`,
            default is ``abs(outseg) / 1000``.

        fres : `float`, `int`, `None`, optional
            Desired frequency resolution (Hertz) of output `Spectrogram`,
            or, if ``logf=True``, the number of frequency samples;
            give `None` to skip this step and return the original resolution,
            default is 0.5 Hz or 500 frequency samples.

        logf : `bool`, optional
            If `True`, use logarithmically sampled frequencies in the output
            (using ``fres`` as the number of frequency samples),
            otherwise use linearly sampled frequencies of the specified resolution.

        norm : `bool`, `str`, optional
            If `True` normalise the returned Q-transform output by the median;
            if `False` do not normalize; if a string, specify
            how to normalize the output, e.g. ``'mean'`` or ``'median'``.

        mismatch : `float`
            Maximum allowed fractional mismatch between neighbouring tiles.

        outseg : `~gwpy.segments.Segment`, optional
            GPS `[start, stop)` segment for output `Spectrogram`,
            default is the full duration of the input.

        whiten : `bool`, `~gwpy.frequencyseries.FrequencySeries`, optional
            If `True`, whiten the data before computing the Q-transform;
            if `False`, do not whiten the data; if a `FrequencySeries`,
            use that as the amplitude spectral density (ASD) to whiten the data.

        fduration : `float`, optional
            Duration (in seconds) of the time-domain FIR whitening filter,
            only used if `whiten` is not `False`, defaults to 2 seconds.

        highpass : `float`, optional
            Highpass corner frequency (in Hz) of the FIR whitening filter,
            used only if `whiten` is not `False`, default: `None`.

        asd_kw
            Keyword arguments to pass to `TimeSeries.asd` to generate
            an ASD to use when whitening the data.

        Returns
        -------
        out : `~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram`
            Output `Spectrogram` of normalised Q energy.

        See Also
        --------
        TimeSeries.asd
            For documentation on acceptable ``**asd_kw``.

        TimeSeries.whiten
            For documentation on how the whitening is done.

        gwpy.signal.qtransform
            For code and documentation on how the Q-transform is implemented.

        Notes
        -----
        This method will return a `Spectrogram` of dtype ``float32`` if
        ``norm`` is given, and ``float64`` otherwise.

        To optimize plot rendering with `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh`,
        the output `~gwpy.spectrogram.Spectrogram` can be given a log-sampled
        frequency axis by passing `logf=True` at runtime. The `fres` argument
        is then the number of points on the frequency axis. Note, this is
        incompatible with `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.imshow`.

        It is also highly recommended to use the `outseg` keyword argument
        when only a small window around a given GPS time is of interest. This
        will speed up this method a little, but can greatly speed up
        rendering the resulting `Spectrogram` using `pcolormesh`.

        If you aren't going to use `pcolormesh` in the end, don't worry.

        --------
        >>> from numpy.random import normal
        >>> from scipy.signal import gausspulse
        >>> from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries

        Generate a `TimeSeries` containing Gaussian noise sampled at 4096 Hz,
        centred on GPS time 0, with a sine-Gaussian pulse ('glitch') at
        500 Hz:

        >>> noise = TimeSeries(
        ...     normal(loc=1, size=4096*4),
        ...     sample_rate=4096,
        ...     epoch=-2,
        ... )
        >>> glitch = TimeSeries(
        ...     gausspulse(noise.times.value, fc=500) * 4,
        ...     sample_rate=4096,
        ... )
        >>> data = noise + glitch

        Compute and plot the Q-transform of these data:

        >>> q = data.q_transform()
        >>> plot = q.plot()
        >>> ax = plot.gca()
        >>> ax.set_xlim(-.2, .2)
        >>> ax.set_epoch(0)
        >>> plot.show()
