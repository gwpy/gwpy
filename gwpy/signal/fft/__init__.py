"""FFT routines for GWpy

This sub-package provides wrappers of a given average spectrum package,
with each API registering relevant FrequencySeries-generation methods, so
that they can be accessed via the ``'method'`` keyword argument of the given
`TimeSeries` instance method, e.g.`TimeSeries.psd`.

See the online docs for full details.

For developers, to add another method to an existing API, simply write the
function into the sub-module and call

>>> fft_registry.register_method(my_new_method)

to register it.

To add another API from scratch, copy the format of the `gwpy.signal.fft.scipy`
module, and then add it to the import below. The imports are ordered by
preference (after `basic`).
