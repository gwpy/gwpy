"""Remote file I/O utilities for GWpy.

This module provides the `open_remote_file` function, which is applied
automatically when reading all files with the `gwpy.io.registry.UnifiedRead`
registry reader.
This means that operations like `TimeSeries.read("http://...")` can access
remote data.

The `open_remote_file` function also handles (or tries to handle) Pelican
URLs, via a hand-off to the function of the same name in `gwpy.io.pelican`.

    This function is a wrapper around `astropy.utils.data.get_readable_fileobj`

      is set to something 'truthy'.

    - If the URL looks like a |Pelican|_ URL, hand off to a dedicated
      Pelican download wrapper to attempt the remote access.

    Parameters
    ----------
    url : `str`, file-like
        The name of the resource to access. Can be a local path, or a
        `file://` URL, or any remote URL supported by Astropy.

    cache : `bool`
        Whether to cache the contents of remote URLs.
        Default is `True` if the ``GWPY_CACHE`` environment variable
        is set to something 'truthy'.

    encoding : `str`, optional
        When ``'binary'`` (default), returns a file-like object where its
        ``read`` method returns `bytes` objects.

        When `None`, returns a file-like object with a
        ``read`` method that returns `str` (``unicode``) objects, using
        `locale.getpreferredencoding` as an encoding.  This matches
        the default behavior of the built-in `open` when no ``mode``
        argument is provided.

        When another string, it is the name of an encoding, and the
        file-like object's ``read`` method will return `str` (``unicode``)
        objects, decoded from binary using the given encoding.

    kwargs
        All other positional and keyword arguments are passed directly
        to `astropy.utils.data.get_readable_fileobj`.

    Returns
    -------
    file : file-like
        The file opened in binary format.
