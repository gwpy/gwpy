def bool_env(

    """Parse an environment variable as a boolean switch.

    `True` is returned if the variable value matches one of the following:

    - ``'1'``
    - ``'y'``
    - ``'yes'``
    - ``'true'``

    The match is case-insensitive (so ``'Yes'`` will match as `True`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    key : `str`
        The name of the environment variable to find.

    default : `bool`
        The default return value if the key is not found.

    Returns
    -------
    True
        If the environment variable matches as 'yes' or similar.
    False
        Otherwise.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ['GWPY_VALUE'] = 'yes'
    >>> print(bool_env('GWPY_VALUE'))
    True
    >>> os.environ['GWPY_VALUE'] = 'something else'
    >>> print(bool_env('GWPY_VALUE'))
    False
    >>> print(bool_env('GWPY_VALUE2'))
