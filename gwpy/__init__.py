"""A python package for gravitational-wave astrophysics.

GWpy is a collaboration-driven `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package
providing tools for studying data from ground-based gravitational-wave
detectors.

GWpy provides a user-friendly, intuitive interface to the common time-domain
and frequency-domain data produced by the `LIGO <http://www.ligo.org>`_ and
`Virgo <http://www.ego-gw.it>`_ instruments and their analysis,
with easy-to-follow tutorials at each step.

    This is mainly useful for scripts and interactive sessions to enable

    For more control over logging, set up logging manually using the
    standard Python :mod:`logging` module, or see :ref:`gwpy-logging`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    level : int, optional
        The logging level to use.
        If not provided, the level from the ``GWPY_LOG_LEVEL`` environment
        variable will be used.
        If that variable is not set, ``INFO`` is used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import gwpy
