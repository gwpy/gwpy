"""This module extends the functionality of the :mod:`astropy.table`
library for reading/writing/manipulating hetergeneous data tables.

Importing the `~astropy.table.Table` object from here via

    >>> from gwpy.table import Table

loads extra input/output definitions available for
:meth:`~astropy.table.Table.read` and :meth:`~astropy.table.Table.write`.

Additionally, the `EventTable` object is provided to simplify working with
tables of time-stamped GW (or other) events.
