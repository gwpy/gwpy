"""This module extends the functionality of the :mod:`glue.ligolw`
library for reading/writing/manipulating LIGO_LW format XML tables.

The :mod:`glue.ligolw.lsctables` library defines a number of specific
tables used in GW data analysis; this module extends their functionality
with the unified input/output system (the .read() method).

Additionally, for event tables (burst, inspiral, and ringdown), methods
to calculate event rate are also attached.

Users can make the extensions available by either importing the
:mod:`~glue.ligolw.lsctables` module from gwpy as follows::

    >>> from gwpy.table import lsctables

or simply importing the :mod:`gwpy.table` module at any point before
using the lsctables module (even after importing it from glue)::

    >>> from glue.ligolw import lsctables
    >>> import gwpy.table
