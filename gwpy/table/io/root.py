    Parameters
    ----------
    source : `str`, `pathlib.Path`
        The file path or object from which to read. See `uproot.open`
        for details on acceptable inputs.

    treename : `str`, optional
        The name of the ``TTree`` to read.
        Required unless ``source`` contains exactly one ``TTree``.

    columns : `list` of `str`, optional
        List of column names to read.

    where : `str`, `list` of `str`, optional
        One or more column filters with which to downselect the
        returned table rows as they as read, e.g. ``'snr > 5'``,
        similar to a SQL ``WHERE`` statement.
        Multiple conditions should be connected by ' && ' or ' and ',
        or given as a `list`, e.g. ``'snr > 5 && frequency < 1000'`` or
        ``['snr > 5', 'frequency < 1000']``.

    kwargs
        All other keyword arguments are either passed to
        `uproot.open` or to the `~astropy.table.Table` constructor.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``treename=None`` is given and multiple trees exist in

    KeyError
        If ``treename`` is given but no tree is found with that name.
