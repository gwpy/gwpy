"""Filter functions for use with :meth:`EventTable.filter`

Each of these functions has the same input and output format.
The inputs must be

- ``columns`` (`str`) : the name of the column to use
- ``operand`` : the operand to the filter

No other arguments or keywords are supported.

The output must be a index array indicating for each row in the
associated table whether it should be returned by the filter or not:
`True` means to be returned, and `False` to be discarded.
