class SegmentList(segmentlist):
    """A `list` of `Segments <Segment>`

    The `SegmentList` provides additional methods that assist in the
    manipulation of lists of `Segments <Segment>`. In particular,
    arithmetic operations such as union and intersection are provided.
    Unlike the `Segment`, the `SegmentList` is closed under all supported
    arithmetic operations.

    All standard Python sequence-like operations are supported, like
    slicing, iteration and so on, but the arithmetic and other methods
    in this class generally expect the `SegmentList` to be in what is
    refered to as a "coalesced" state - consisting solely of disjoint
    `Segments <Segment>` listed in ascending order. Using the standard Python
    sequence-like operations, a `SegmentList` can be easily constructed
    that is not in this state;  for example by simply appending a
    `Segment` to the end of the list that overlaps some other `Segment`
    already in the list. The class provides a :meth:`~SegmentList.coalesce`
    method that can be called to put it in the coalesced state. Following
    application of the coalesce method, all arithmetic operations will
    function reliably. All arithmetic methods themselves return
    coalesced results, so there is never a need to call the coalesce
    method when manipulating a `SegmentList` exclusively via the
    arithmetic operators.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = SegmentList([Segment(-10, 10)])
    >>> x |= SegmentList([Segment(20, 30)])
    >>> x -= SegmentList([Segment(-5, 5)])
    >>> print(x)
    [Segment(-10, -5), Segment(5, 10), Segment(20, 30)]
    >>> print(~x)
    [Segment(-infinity, -10), Segment(-5, 5), Segment(10, 20),
     Segment(30, infinity)]

class SegmentListDict(segmentlistdict):
    """A `dict` of `SegmentLists <SegmentList>`

    This class implements a standard mapping interface, with additional
    features added to assist with the manipulation of a collection of
    `SegmentList` objects. In particular, methods for taking unions and
    intersections of the lists in the dictionary are available, as well
    as the ability to record and apply numeric offsets to the
    boundaries of the `Segments <Segment>` in each list.

    The numeric offsets are stored in the "offsets" attribute, which
    itself is a dictionary, associating a number with each key in the
    main dictionary. Assigning to one of the entries of the offsets
    attribute has the effect of shifting the corresponding `SegmentList`
    from its original position (not its current position) by the given
    amount.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = SegmentListDict()
    >>> x["H1"] = SegmentList([Segment(0, 10)])
    >>> print(x)
    {'H1': [Segment(0, 10)]}
