"""The `astro` module provides methods for sensitivity calculations of
gravitational-wave interferometer data.

The LIGO project measures time-dependent sensitivity by calculating the
distance at which the gravitational-wave signature of a binary neutron star
(BNS) inspiral would be recorded by an instrument with a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of 8.
In most of the literature, this is known as the 'inspiral range' or the
'horizon distance'.

The following methods are provided in order to calculate the sensitive
distance range of a detector

.. autosummary::

   ~gwpy.astro.inspiral_range
   ~gwpy.astro.inspiral_range_spectrum
   ~gwpy.astro.burst_range
   ~gwpy.astro.burst_range_spectrum

Each of the above methods has been given default parameters corresponding to
the standard usage by the LIGO project.
