# -- GWpy CI/CD pipeline
#
# The configuration below is designed (badly, probably) to
# maximise the test coverage (minimise risk of breakages)
# whilst also minimising duplicate use of CI/CD credits for
# the GWpy project or individual contributors.

stages:
  - check
  - build
  - test
  - conda
  - docs
  - deploy
