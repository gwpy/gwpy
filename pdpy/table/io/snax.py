    Parameters
    ----------
    source : `h5py.File`
        the file path of open `h5py` object from which to read the data

    channels : `str` or `list`, optional
        the channel(s) to read data from. if no channels selected,
        read in all channels

    on_missing: `str`, optional
        how to proceed when channels requested are missing. choose one from:
            * ``'warn'``: emit a warning when missing channels are discovered
            * ``'error'``: raise an exception
        default is 'error'.

    compact : `bool`, optional, default: False
        whether to store a compact integer representation in the channel
        column rather than the full channel name, instead storing a mapping
        (`channel_map`) in the table metadata.
