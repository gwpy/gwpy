A large quantity of important data from gravitational-wave detectors
can be distilled into simple boolean (`True` or `False`) statements
informing something about the state of the instrument at a given time.
These statements can be used to identify times during which a particular
control system was active, or when the signal in a seismometer was above
an alarming threshold, for example.
In GWpy, these data are represented by special cases (`sub-classes`) of
the `TimeSeries` object:

   StateTimeSeries
   StateVector

============================
The :class:`StateTimeSeries`
============================

The example of a threshold on signal time-series is the core of a large
amount of low-level data quality information, used in searches for
gravitational waves, and detector characterisation, and is described by the
:class:`StateTimeSeries` object, a specific type of :class:`TimeSeries`
containing only boolean values.

These arrays can be generated from simple arrays of booleans, as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from gwpy.timeseries import StateTimeSeries
   >>> state = StateTimeSeries(
   ...     [True, True, False, False, False, True, False],
   ...     sample_rate=1,
   ...     epoch=1064534416,
   ... )
   >>> print(state)
   StateTimeSeries([ True,  True, False, False, False,  True, False]
                   unit: dimensionless,
                   t0: 1064534416.0 s,
                   dt: 1.0 s,
                   name: None,
                   channel: None)

Alternatively, applying a standard mathematical comparison to a regular
:class:`TimeSeries` will return a :class:`StateTimeSeries`:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
   >>> laserpower = TimeSeries.get(
   ...     "H1:IMC-PWR_IN_OUT_DQ",
   ...     1186741850,
   ...     1186741870,
   ...     host="losc-nds.ligo.org",
   ... )
   >>> threshold = 29.2 > laserpower.unit
   >>> above_29_2 = laserpower > threshold
   >>> print(above_2915)
   StateTimeSeries([False, False, False, ..., False, False, False]
                   unit: dimensionless,
                   t0: 1186741850.0 s,
                   dt: 0.00048828125 s,
                   name: H1:IMC-PWR_IN_OUT_DQ > 29.2 NONE,
                   channel: H1:IMC-PWR_IN_OUT_DQ)

The :class:`StateTimeSeries` includes a handy
:meth:`StateTimeSeries.to_dqflag` method to convert the boolean array
into a :class:`~gwpy.segments.DataQualityFlag`, where the ``active``
segments represent times of `True` values:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> segments = above_29_2.to_dqflag(round=True)
   >>> print(segments)
   <DataQualityFlag('H1:IMC-PWR_IN_OUT_DQ > 29.2 NONE',
                    known=[[1186741850.0 ... 1186741870.0)]
                    active=[[1186741854.0 ... 1186741856.0)
                            [1186741859.0 ... 1186741861.0)
                            [1186741865.0 ... 1186741867.0)]
                    description=None)>

.. admonition:: ``round=True``

   Here we included the keyword ``round=True`` to pad out ``active``
   segments to be at least one second long.
   The usage in this example is purely demonstrative, but is used regularly
   when constructing *data quality flags* for excising bad data from
   analyses, mainly because integer segments are easier to deal with.

=======================
Multi-bit state-vectors
=======================

While the :class:`StateTimeSeries` represents a single `True`/`False`
statement about the state of a system, the :class:`StateVector` gives a
grouping of these, representing a
`bit array <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array>`__ where each bit
represents a single `True`/`False` (on/off) binary state in a system.
This provides a compact representation of a complex system, with utility
methods to transform and visualise the myriad states.

Each |GWOSC|_ data release includes a bit vector that describes the
data-quality states of the detector.

.. admonition:: GWOSC data usage notes

   Refer to the GWOSC
   `data usage notes <https://gwosc.org/yellow_box/>`__
   page for details of the various bits (states) in the state vectors.

To demonstate, we can download the `StateVector` associated with
|GW200105|_, the first detection of a mixed black hole/neutron star
binary system:

.. plot::
   :context: reset
   :nofigs:

   >>> from gwosc.datasets import event_gps
   >>> from gwpy.timeseries import StateVector
   >>> gps = event_gps("GW200105_162426")
   >>> start = int(gps) - 1000
   >>> end = int(gps) + 1000
   >>> gw200105_state = StateVector.fetch_open_data("L1", start, end)
   >>> print(gw200105_state)
   StateVector([127, 127, 127, ..., 127, 127, 127]
               unit: dimensionless,
               t0: 1262275684.0 s,
               dt: 1.0 s,
               name: Data quality,
               channel: None,
               bits: Bits(0: Passes DATA test
                           1: Passes CBC_CAT1 test
                           2: Passes CBC_CAT2 test
                           3: Passes CBC_CAT3 test
                           4: Passes BURST_CAT1 test
                           5: Passes BURST_CAT2 test
                           6: Passes BURST_CAT3 test,
                           channel=None,
                           epoch=1262274636.0))

As can be seen, the list of :attr:`~StateVector.bits` is represented
through the :class:`BitMask` class, recording the bits as a list with
some metdata about their purpose.

The `StateVector` fetched in the above example can then be parsed into a
series of :class:`~gwpy.segments.DataQualityFlag` objects, recording the
active segments for that bit in the vector:

.. plot::
   :context:
   :nofigs:

   >>> flags = gw200105_state.to_dqflags()
   >>> print(flags["Passes BURST_CAT3 test"])
   <DataQualityFlag('Passes BURST_CAT3 test',
                    known=[[1262275684.0 ... 1262277684.0)]
                    active=[[1262275684.0 ... 1262276525.0)
                            [1262276527.0 ... 1262277684.0)]
                    description=None)>

Here we can see that there are two active segments for the
*Passes BURST_CAT3 test* bit, indicating that there is a short interval
(2 seconds in this case) where the ``BURST_CAT3`` data quality check failed.

========================
Plotting a `StateVector`
========================

A :class:`StateVector` can be trivially plotted in two ways,
specified by the ``format`` keyword argument of the :meth:`~StateVector.plot`
method:

.. table:: Keyword arguments for `StateVector.plot`
   :align: left
   :name: statevector-plot-kwargs

   ================  =============================================================
   Format            Description
   ================  =============================================================
   ``'segments'``    A bit-wise representation of each bit in the vector (default)
   ``'timeseries'``  A standard time-series representation
   ================  =============================================================

For example,

.. plot::
   :include-source:
   :context:

   >>> plot = gw200105_state.plot(insetlabels=True)
   >>> plot.show()

In this figure the black vertical lines (actually very dark green) show
visually the short interval where both the ``BURST_CAT2`` and
``BURST_CAT3`` data-quality checks failed, just over 2 minutes prior to
the GW200102 event detection.

.. admonition:: Bit labelling

   For a ``format='segments'`` display, the :attr:`~StateVector.bits`
   attribute of the `StateVector` is used to identify and label each
   of the binary bits in the vector.

.. admonition:: ``insetlabels``

   The ``insetlabels=True`` keyword was given to display the bit labels
   inside the axes (otherwise they would be cut off the side of the figure).

==================
Associated classes
==================

Alongside the :class:`StateVector` class, :mod:`gwpy.timeseries` provides a
:class:`StateVectorDict` for handling collections of bit-vector data
(mainly to enable reading and writing multiple `StateVector` in one operation).
