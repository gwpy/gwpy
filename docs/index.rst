GWpy is a collaboration-driven `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package
providing tools for studying data from ground-based gravitational-wave
detectors.

GWpy provides a user-friendly, intuitive interface to the common time-domain
and frequency-domain data produced by the `LIGO <http://www.ligo.org>`_ and
`Virgo <http://www.ego-gw.it>`_ instruments and their analysis,
with easy-to-follow tutorials at each step.
