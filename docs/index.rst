   .. warning::

      You are viewing documentation for a development build of GWpy.
      This version may include unstable code, or breaking changes relative
      the most recent stable release.
      To view the documentation for the latest stable release of GWpy, please
      `click here <../stable/>`_.

GWpy is a collaboration-driven `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package
providing tools for studying data from ground-based gravitational-wave
detectors.

GWpy provides a user-friendly, intuitive interface to the common time-domain
and frequency-domain data produced by the `LIGO <http://www.ligo.org>`_ and
`Virgo <http://www.ego-gw.it>`_ instruments and their analysis,
with easy-to-follow tutorials at each step.
