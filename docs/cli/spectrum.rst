Spectrum plots
===========================

Spectrum plots label their axes as F and Y.  It defaults to a log-log plot the most common if not
standard presentation in LIGO.  To manually set the limits of the plot use ``--fmin`` and ``--fmax``
for the frequency axis and ``--ymin`` and ``--ymax`` for the Amplitude axis.  If any are left blank
they are set to the min or max of the data.

If you prefer linear axes use the ``--nologf`` and ``--nology`` parameters.  This can be useful
to zoom in on peaks and lines in the spectrum.

The spectrum presented is an average of multiple FFTs controled by ``--secpfft`` and ``--overlap``.
``--secpfft`` specifies the length of the FFT in seconds (not limited to powers of 2 or integers)
and ``--overlap`` specifies a fractional overlap for the next FFT.  For example a 1 second FFT of a
100 Hz channel with an overlap of 0.1 would generate the first FFT with samples 0-99 and the second
FFT with samples 10-109.  More overlap results in more averaging and a higher SNR.  Longer FFTs
result in better frequency resolution and less "frequency bleed".

For example the following command line produces a fairly high frequency resolution plot of
OAF-CAL_DARM from the 2014-02-14 lock at LLO:

.. code-block:: sh

    gwpy-plot spectrum --chan L1:OAF-CAL_DARM_DQ --start 1107936067 --duration 120  --secpfft 10

.. image:: cli-sp-01.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Spectrum of OAF-CAL_DARM

To zoom in on the lines between 500 and 700 Hz we could use the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    gwpy-plot spectrum --chan L1:OAF-CAL_DARM_DQ --start 1107936067 --duration 120 \
     --secpfft 10.000 --overlap 0.90 --nologf --fmin 500 --fmax 700

.. image:: cli-sp-02.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Zoom into spectrum of OAF-CAL_DARM

Because the question such a plot could answer is exactly where are the lines, we use a linear
frequency axis.  Longer FFTs and a smaller frequency range would produce more resolution.
