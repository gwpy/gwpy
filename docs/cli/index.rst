Command line plotting with GWpy
**************************************

LigoDV-web (https://ldvw.ligo.caltech.edu) is a web based tool for viewing LIGO
data.  With the availability of GWpy we have undergone a transformation from
using our own plotting functions to using GWpy.  Since ldvw is written in Java
the most effective way to do this was to develop a command line program to
generate each of the plots.  This program is now part of the GWpy distribution
and can be used on any machine with GWpy installed including Condor compute nodes.

The general form of the command is:

.. code-block:: sh

    gwpy-plot ACTION REQUIRED-ARGUMENTS or --help [OPTIONS]

Where ACTION is the name of the plot to make.  If you run the script without any agruments it will list
the actions.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ gwpy-plot
    usage: gwpy-plot [-h]
                     {timeseries,coherence,spectrum,spectrogram,coherencegram} ...
    gwpy-plot: error: too few arguments

To see the available options for any action add the action keyword.  For example:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ gwpy-plot timeseries
    usage: gwpy-plot timeseries [-h] [-v] [-s SILENT] --chan CHAN [CHAN ...]
                                --start START [START ...] [--duration DURATION]
                                [-c FRAMECACHE] [--highpass HIGHPASS] [--logx]
                                [--xmin XMIN] [--xmax XMAX] [-g GEOMETRY]
                                [--interactive] [--logy] [--title TITLE]
                                [--suptitle SUPTITLE] [--xlabel XLABEL]
                                [--ylabel YLABEL] [--out OUT]
                                [--legend [LEGEND [LEGEND ...]]] [--nolegend]
                                [--nogrid] [--ymin YMIN] [--ymax YMAX]

A ``-h`` or ``--help`` after the action will provide an explanation of each option.  Since most
options are shared among several actions we will discuss them in groups.

The program tries to choose reasonable defaults so the only required arguments for most plots are
one channel and one start time, some plots like coherence require two channels.  For example:

.. code-block:: sh

    gwpy-plot timeseries --chan L1:OAF-CAL_DARM_DQ --start 1102766651

Will produce a image file called gwpy.png in the current directory that looks like:

.. image:: cli-01.png
    :align: center
    :alt: sample time series no parameters specified

To generate that image several assumptions were made such as using 10 sec of data from a default
NDS2 server, scaling the plot to
the full range on both X and Y axes, using standard labeling and output went to a generic file in
the current directory.  All of this is customizable, plus we can use log scaling or high pass filter the
data before plotting.

The options for each action vary but many are common.

Specify input data
==================

The line plots: time series, spectrum, and coherence accept multiple channels and multiple times,
while the image plots:
spectrogram and coherence-spectrogram accept only one (spectrogram) or two (coherence-spectrogram)
channel(s) and one time.

**Channels** are specified using their full name and it is case sensitive.
Use the ``--chan`` argument followed by the channel name as many times as needed

**Start times** are specified in GPS seconds.  Use the ``--start`` argument followed by the start time
as many times as needed.

**Duration** is specified in seconds using the ``--duration`` keyword.  There is only
one duration and it applies to all channels and all start times.

By default all data is pulled from an appropriate NDS2 server using GWpy's algorithm to decide which
servers to try, in what order.  You can use the ``-c`` or ``--framecache`` argument to
specify a LAL style frame cache if you prefer to get the data from .gwf frame files.

Prefiltering data
==================

Data may be high pass filtered with a Butterworth window before any processing or plotting is done.
The ``--highpass <cutoff frequency (Hz)>`` pair specifies the filter.

Titles, lables, and legends
============================

The figure below is a spectrum that was generated with the command line:

.. code-block:: sh

    gwpy-plot spectrum --chan L1:OAF-CAL_DARM_DQ --start 1102766451 1102766651 --out spectrum.png

.. image:: cli-02.png
    :align: center
    :alt: sample spectrum

The top line is called the **super title** and is overridden with the ``--suptitle`` directive followed
by the new supertitle which may be plain text or LaTex.  There can be only 1 supertitle and it is one
line only.  Be sure to put quotes (" or ') around any string with spaces or special characters.

The line below that is called the **title** and is overridden with the ``--title`` directive followed by
the new title.  There can be multiple titles limited only by space available on the image.

The **X-axis** and the **Y-axis** labels are set with the ``--xlabel`` and ``-ylabel`` argument.

The **legends** only appear by default when more than one dataset is plotted.  The text for each legend
can be set with the ``--legend`` argument, one for each dataset.  The ``--nolegend`` argument turns
off all legends.

The **gridlines** are shown by default.  To remove them from the plot use the ``--nogrid`` argument.

Interactive mode
=================

The ``--interactive`` argument uses the matplotlib/pyplot show function to display an image and allow
simple manipulations such as zoom, pan, and comfigure subplots.  There is also a save function.  gwpy-plot
will also save the image generated. Interactive mode is described in detail in the :ref:`interactive`
section.

Customizing individual plots
============================

Individual plots may have different default behavior and different arguments.  This section
discussed options that behave the same for all plots.  See the appropriate section below for the
remainder of the arguments for each plot.
