Publishing a release
####################

This page describes the steps required to author a release of GWpy.

Notes:

* gwpy uses the
  `stable mainline <https://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-stable-mainline-branching-model-for-git/>`_
  branching model for releases
* all release numbers must follow `Semantic Versioning 2 <segmver.org>`_ and
  include major, minor, and patch numbers, e.g. ``X.Y.Z`` rather than
  ``1.0`` or just ``1``

============
Step-by-step
============

#. **If this is a bug-fix release, just check out that branch**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout release/X.Y.x

#. **Update the copyright**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -c "from setup_utils import update_all_copyright; update_all_copyright()"
      git commit -S -m "Updated copyright for release" .

#. **Publish the release**, allowing CI to run, and others to see it:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git push -u origin main

   for major/minor releases, or

   .. code-block:: bash

      git push -u origin release/X.Y.x

   for bug-fix releases

#. **Wait patiently for the continuous integration to finish**

#. **Announce the release** and ask for final contributions

#. **Tag the release**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git tag --sign vX.Y.Z

#. **Create a maintenance branch** (major/minor releases only):

   .. code-block:: bash

      git branch release/X.Y.x

#. **Publish everything**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # push maintenance branch
      git push --signed=if-asked origin release/X.Y.x
      # push main branch
      git push --signed=if-asked origin main
      # push new tag
      git push --signed=if-asked origin vX.Y.Z

#. **Draft a release on GitHub**

   * Go to https://github.com/gwpy/gwpy/releases/new
   * Use ``vX.Y.Z`` as the *Tag version*
   * Use X.Y.Z as the *Release title*
   * Copy the tag message into the text box to serve as release notes

#. **Publish the release documentation**

   This is done from the LDAS computing centre at Caltech:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /home/duncan.macleod/gwpy-nightly-build/
      bash release-build.sh X.Y.Z

   Once that is complete (~20 minutes), a few manual updates must be made:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /home/duncan.macleod/gwpy-nightly-build/gwpy.github.io/docs
      unlink stable && ln -s X.Y.Z stable
      sed -i 's/0.9.9/X.Y.Z/g' index.html

   The final command should be modified to replace the previous release ID
   with the current one.

   Then:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git commit --gpg-sign --message="X.Y.Z: release docs"
      git push --signed=if-asked  # <- this step needs an SSH key

   It should take ~5 minutes for the release documentation to actually
   appear on https://gwpy.github.io/docs/

==============
Linked updates
==============

Zenodo
------

Creating a new release on GitHub will automatically trigger a new DOI on
https://zenodo.org.

====================================
Distributing the new release package
====================================

Package distributions for PyPI, Conda, Debian, and RHEL are done manually:

PyPI
----

To create a new release on PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   rm -rf dist/
   git checkout vX.Y.Z
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   gpg --armor --detach-sign dist/gwpy-*.tar.gz
   twine upload dist/gwpy-*

Conda
-----

Once the PyPI upload has completed, the conda-forge bot will automatically
open a pull request to `conda-forge/gwpy-feedstock
<https://github.com/conda-forge/gwpy-feedstock.git>`_.
Just double-check that the dependencies and tests are up-to-date, then
merge.

Debian/RHEL
-----------

* Upload the source tarball to software.ligo.org
* Open a new request to `sccb/requests <https://git.ligo.org/sccb/requests/>`_
  to announce the new release and request package build and deployment.
