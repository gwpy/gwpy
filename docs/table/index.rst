############
Tabular data
############

Alongside the `timeseries <../timeseries>`_ data produced continuously at the
laboratories, the gravitational-wave community produces a number of different
sets of tabular data, including segments of time indicating interferometer
state, and transient event triggers.

==========================
The ``LIGO_LW`` XML format
==========================

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration uses a custom scheme of XML in which to
store tabular data, called the ``LIGO_LW`` scheme.
Complementing the scheme is a python library - :mod:`glue.ligolw` - which
allows users to read and write all of the different types of tabular data
produced by gravitational-wave searches.

The remainder of this document outlines the small number of extensions that
GWpy provides for the table classes provided by :mod:`glue.ligolw`.

.. note::

   All users should review the original documentation for :mod:`glue.ligolw`
   to get any full sense of how to use these objects.

=========================
Reading ``LIGO_LW`` files
=========================

GWpy annotates all of the :class:`~glue.ligolw.table.Table` subclasses defined
in :mod:`glue.ligolw.lsctables` to make reading those tables from ``LIGO_LW``
XML files a bit easier.

These annotations hook into the unified input/output scheme used for all of
the other core data classes.
For example, you can read a table of single-interferometer burst events as
follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/table/scatter.py
   :lines: 35,38

For full details, check out the :meth:`~SnglBurstTable.read` documentation.

=======================
Plotting event triggers
=======================

The other annotation GWpy defines provides a simple plotting method for a
number of classes.

We can extend the above example to include plotting:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/table/scatter.py
   :append: plot.show()
   :lines: 41-46

.. plot:: ../examples/table/scatter.py

|

These code snippets are part of the GWpy example on
:doc:`plotting event triggers <../examples/table/scatter>`.

====================
Plotting event tiles
====================

Many types of event triggers define a 2-dimensional tile, for example in time and frequency.
These tiles can be plotted in a similar manner to simple triggers.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/table/tiles.py
   :append: plot.show()
   :lines: 42-47

.. plot:: ../examples/table/tiles.py

|

These code snippets are part of the GWpy example on
:doc:`plotting events as 2-d tiles <../examples/table/tiles>`.
